## UCB_optimization_ACRs
# Overview
This repository contains code used for utilizing machine-learning models to design enzyme sequences with improved activity. The models rely on upper confidence bound (UCB) optimization, a strategy that balances exploiting regions of the sequence-function landscape that are highly active, and exploring new regions of the landscape.
